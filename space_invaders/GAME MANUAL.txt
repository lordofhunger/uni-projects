--START
- To start the game you have to open the folder
  called game files, in which you will find the
  file called HYPERSPACE INVADERS.rkt, if you
  click this you can start playing the game.
- Winning/Losing a level: If you win a level,
  the game continues, if you lose, you see a
  "GAME OVER" screen, despite this making it
  seem like the game is over you can simply
  restart by pressing the 'R' key on your 
  keyboard.

-- KEYS
- Use 'P' to freeze or unfreeze the screen.
- Use the left '<' and right '>' arrow keys
  to move your x-wing left or right to dodge
  enemy bolts or catch powerups, but look
  closely at what you catch, because not all
  powerups have a positive effect (II, V, VII
  and IX).
- Use the up arrow '^' to shoot bolts at the
  enemy fleet.
- You can press shift and a number on your
  keyboard to use the corresponding powerup.

-- INFORMATION
- You can find a lot of information on the
  top bar, the most left number tells you the
  current difficulty, which goes up every five
  levels, the number next to that lets you
  keep track of which level you are on,
  and the third number tells you the amount
  of lives you have left.
  On the right hand side of the screen you
  can see the scoreboard, the number on the
  left is the current score, and the number
  on the right is the highscore, which you
  have to try to beat. Good luck!
