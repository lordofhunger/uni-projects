## Space Invaders in R5RS
This directory contains code for a Star Wars themed version of the game Space Invaders, made in R5RS.

This code is shared so others may learn from it and to show it to people I know, this code will not 
work when ran locally, because there is a folder named 'graphics-adt' missing which contains an ADT
written by the assistants of the course, which I don't believe I am allowed to share, as it is not
my own work.
